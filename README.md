# compare-two-int-in-6-languages
A repository comparing integer values using if-else conditions in six popular programming languages - Java, Python, C, C#, C++, and JavaScript.

This repository showcases a comparison of integer values using if-else conditions in six of the most popular programming languages - Java, Python, C, C#, C++, and JavaScript. The aim of this repository is to provide a glimpse into how different programming languages handle the same task, thereby helping new programmers understand the syntax differences and make a better choice for their projects.

The repository contains examples of code snippets for each of the six programming languages that compares two integer values and returns a result based on the comparison. The code snippets demonstrate the use of the if-else statement and how it is implemented in each language.

Whether you're a beginner or an experienced programmer, this repository is a great resource to have in your arsenal. It provides a side-by-side comparison of the syntax used in the six programming languages, making it easier to understand the differences and similarities between them.

So, if you're curious about the world of programming and want to understand how the same task is achieved in different languages, this repository is a must-visit!
